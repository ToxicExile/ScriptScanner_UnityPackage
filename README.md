Full Definition
ScriptScanner is a lightweight Unity Editor utility that scans your project for unused C# scripts and lists them in a simple, scrollable window. It helps developers maintain project hygiene by identifying potentially unused code, reducing clutter, and streamlining workflows. The tool uses a heuristic approach to detect scripts not referenced elsewhere in the codebase and provides console feedback with the number of flagged files. Results should be verified before deletion, making ScriptScanner a safe and effective starting point for keeping projects lean and maintainable.
