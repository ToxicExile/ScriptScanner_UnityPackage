# ScriptScanner_UnityPackage

ScriptScanner is a lightweight Unity Editor utility that scans your project for unused C# scripts and lists them in a simple, scrollable window. It helps developers maintain project hygiene by identifying potentially unused code, reducing clutter, and streamlining workflows. The tool uses a heuristic approach to detect scripts not referenced elsewhere in the codebase and provides console feedback with the number of flagged files. Results should be verified before deletion, making ScriptScanner a safe and effective starting point for keeping projects lean and maintainable.

Key Features:
Scans your project for unused C# scripts,
Simple EditorWindow interface with one‑click project scan,
Scrollable results list with relative asset paths,
Console feedback showing the number of flagged scripts.
